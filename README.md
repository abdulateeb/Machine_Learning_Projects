# Machine Learning Projects

This repository features a collection of machine learning projects that showcase various techniques and applications. Each folder contains a project with its description, solution code, and relevant files.

## Projects

1. [**Predicting Credit Card Fraud with Machine Learning**](credit_card_fraud/)
   - **Description:** A model developed to detect fraudulent credit card transactions, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation to identify anomalies in transaction data.

2. [**Predicting Customer Churn**](customer_churn/)
   - **Description:** A model created to predict customer churn, focusing on identifying customers likely to stop using a service. This project includes data analysis, feature selection, and model tuning to improve retention strategies.

3. [**House Price Prediction**](house_price_prediction/)
   - **Description:** A regression model built to estimate house prices based on features such as location, size, and amenities. This project emphasizes regression analysis and data preprocessing to predict property values accurately.

4. [**Building a Recommendation System**](recommendation_system/)
   - **Description:** A recommendation system designed to suggest products or services based on user preferences, utilizing both collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques.

5. [**Capstone Project: End-to-End Machine Learning**](capstone_project/)
   - **Description:** An end-to-end machine learning project that integrates skills learned throughout the study. It involves data collection, preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and deployment to solve a real-world problem or conduct an in-depth analysis.
